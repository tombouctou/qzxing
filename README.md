QtQuick 2.0 port of the ZXing multi-format 1D/2D barcode image processing library

Based on the great work done in the [original QtQuick 1.0 port][] by [Nikolaos Ftylitakis][].

This repo essentially makes it possible to use the [ZXing][] 1D/2D barcode decoding library in projects
based on the Qt 5.x framework. Although not limited to those, this C++ plugin has been ported to
enable the use of barcode decoding functionality to QML projects based on the Ubuntu SDK.

[Daily packages][] of this plugin are also available for Ubuntu.
